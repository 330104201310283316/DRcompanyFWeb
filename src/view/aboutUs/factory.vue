                       Pre-Production: All styles should have Pre-production meeting before production started. 
                       A team consists of pattern maker, QA, QC, merchandiser, and related supervisors on cutting, 
                       sewing and finishing, will go through all the details and possible risks, and share knowledge 
                       on how to make the bulk properly. QC is responsible for the meeting organization, and all 
                       records will be kept and filed into the style package.

                       One-Piece Flow Assembly Line: The production process is One-piece Flow, with all
                       procedures analyzed, timed, and allocated to most suitable worker, to make sure a most 
                       efficient and qualified production flow for each style. All possible problems can be 
                       quickly identified during the initial flow and be noticed when the first lots come out.
                       <br />
                       In-Line Quality control: Different from normal production flow with one inspector at
                       each line to check the finished garment, we put one more inspector in the middle of the 
                       line to check the semi-products before assembled. Therefore, to minimize the secondary 
                       products without further wasting.

                        Additional Inspection: Since most of our production are free of inspection from customers, we appreciated the trusts and highly value the promises. Thus, to secure all pieces delivered are in good condition, additional inspection of spot check or 100% check by an independent inspection team are conducted before shipment.
