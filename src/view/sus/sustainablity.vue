                        The sense of being sustainable starts from design creation and carries on through the whole sourcing and manufacturing processes. Fashion can only become sustainable when it maximizes benefits to everyone that involves, while minimizing its impact on the environment.

                    <p class="sus_text_p14">
                      To be sustainable fashion, means ethical, environmental and economical. It is far more beyond the environmental concerns, thus not only taking measures to minimize its negative impact relieving the pressure over the air and water pollution, but also ensuring other prominent issues regarding the safety and fair treatment of workers involved.

Also, garment made of recycled fabrics can be recycled continuously, with less degradation of quality, thus to minizine the wastage as well.

                      Apart from the efforts on the supply chain control and eco-friendly materials improvements, there are still lots we can do to reduce and/or recycle the waste, here to mention what else we are contributing:
                     </p>
                     <p class="sus_text_p14"> 
                     	Tao aims to create attractive items with longer lifespan, ultimately reducing waste. We work closely with designers and buyers to adopt a whole lifecycle to product design, to identify textiles can be recycled or re-used
                      </p>
                      <p class="sus_text_p14"> 
                     Tao encourages our partners to use 3D design and pattern, which allow creators to build virtual samples, less waste on sample making and parcel sending
                     </p>
                      <p class="sus_text_p14"> 
                        Tao is working hard on improving accurate specifications of the patterns and cutting with maximum use of materials, and on reducing the errors that would lead to waste during production
                     </p>
                     <p class="sus_text_p14"> 
                     Tao work with suppliers to invest on biotech, to make sure packaging materials, such as polybags, are degradable
                        </p>
                     <p class="sus_text_p14">
                     Tao always take advantage of dead stock and leftover materials, to use fabrics that are already produced and sit on a shelf in a warehouse.
