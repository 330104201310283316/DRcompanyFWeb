                The sense of being sustainable starts from design creation and carries on through the whole sourcing and manufacturing processes. Fashion can only become sustainable when it maximizes benefits to everyone that involves, while minimizing its impact on the environment.
                <br />
                To be sustainable fashion, means ethical, environmental and economical. It is far more beyond the environmental concerns, thus not only taking measures to minimize its negative impact relieving the pressure over the air and water pollution, but also ensuring other prominent issues regarding the safety and fair treatment of workers involved.
                <br />
                Tao, as a manufacturer on the industry chain, is willing to work together with all our brand partners, to make things better now. Indeed, sustainability is big, long-term and broadly based business. We want to make a change; we want to make as little impact on this planet as possible.

            <p class="environmental-p2">
                Every Day At Tao, we are striving to build a transparent and environmentally responsible supply chain.
            </p>
            <p class="environmental-p3">
                Tao requires sustainability not only of our own operations but also of our suppliers, the Supply Chain Management team is devoting to integrate a better supply chain, both ethical and environmental approved. We made regular visit to established suppliers, and require 3rd party inspection when necessary with new suppliers, to ensure the transparency and traceability.               
                <br />
                Suppliers shall ensure that all employees have appropriate knowledge and experience about environmental issues and processes with potential environmental impacts, as well as resources to enable them effectively to meet their responsibilities.
                <br />
                Suppliers should have a full awareness about government-issued environmental regulations, and are encouraged to register with IPE (Institute of Public & Environmental Affairs), while respecting human rights, promoting safe and fair labor practices, and ensuring respect for the environment and high standards of chemical restrictions as well as industry benchmark practices.
                An environmental management strategy covering care for water, energy, chemical management and waste is required for long-term decision making, together with an organized team to monitor and record all related.

                 Care for Water
            </p>
            <p class="environmental-p3">
                Water is one of the strategic resources used in the textile industry，especially in growing raw materials such as cotton, and in Wet Process Facilities.
                Tao is aware of the importance of water as part of the ecosystems, of its shortage and of the need for a responsible use thereof.
                Therefore, Tao’s suppliers and Wet Process Facilities shall ensure that water used comes from authorized supply sources and oversee consumption thereof by installing flow meters. To optimize it, consumption reduction shall be promoted through the recovery of water of condensing processes or the reuse of cooling water at Wet Process Facilities and other such practices.
                All Wet Process Facilities which are part of Tao's supply chain shall ensure that all outgoing wastewater from their processes is treated before it is discharged and that the treated wastewater quality meets the requirements of the local legislation, at a minimum.
            </p>
            <p class="environmental-p4">
                Care for Energy 
            </p>
            <p class="environmental-p3">
                Energy is a critical component of the fashion business and its management requires appropriate solutions at any time to ensure a steady supply thereof of quality. 
                 <br />
                Therefore, suppliers and Wet Process Facilities which are part of Tao's supply chain, shall monitor and reduce energy consumption by taking appropriate measures such as pipes insulation or condensation recovery. 
                <br />
                Procedures and standards for waste management, handling and disposure of chemicals and other dangerous materials, emissions and effluent treatment must meet or exceed minimum legal requirements.

            <p class="environmental-p3">
                Tao is committed to achieving the “zero discharge” goal with regard to potentially hazardous chemicals present in production processes. Solutions revolve around removing the use of substances in origin instead of at the end of the production process and require replacing them with safer alternatives. 
                 <br />
                Therefore, a list of all chemicals used in the facilities shall be made available to suppliers and Wet Process Facilities which are part of Tao's supply chain and they shall duly

            <p class="environmental-p3">
                The efficient use of resources and the reduction, reuse and recycling of waste needs to be encouraged to achieve an environmentally sustainable production and a reduction in the demand of natural resources and ecosystems. 
                <br />
                Therefore, suppliers and Wet Process Facilities which are part of Tao's supply chain, shall sort, store and control the waste emitted by them prior to its disposal by the supplier, manufacturer or any authorized manager, preventing at all times the unauthorized burning of waste at their facilities or outside. 
                <br />
                Likewise, for the shipment of goods manufactured by Tao, suppliers shall ensure the appropriate compliance with that in the area of packaging for the purposes of reducing, reusing and recycling materials used in packaging.

               More Sustainable Alternative Materials
            </p>
            <p class="environmental-p3">
                Garment production begins with the design and choice of raw material which determine much of a garment's destiny and impact, and the structure of the supply chain, as well as the possibility of sustainability. Actually, the biggest and main pollution of the industry comes from the manufacturing of raw materials. Thus, the first and the main initiatives is to find alternatives, that are more sustainable and eco-friendly materials, also, colors and prints should be subject to the availability of eco-friendly dyes. 
                <br />
                Tao strives to advocate the most sustainable materials from our suppliers to our clients, and invests in new fabric innovations to ensure we’re reducing our impact on the planet. We prioritize organic and natural fibers, but use recycled synthetics where they have a clear performance and/or durability advantage.

                Recycled Fabrics 
            </p>
            <p class="environmental-p3">
                Polyester is still accounting for a main part of the textile, but the production of regular fiber involves huge quantities of water, and chemicals. Hence companies have made great progress to create polyester out of recycled plastic bottles or even recycled polyester fabric. Same advances on nylon and spandex fiber. 
                  <br />
                The recycled fiber gives a second life to a material that’s not biodegradable and would otherwise end up in landfill or the ocean. It is almost the same as virgin fiber in terms of quality, but it uses much less energy during the production. Also, garment made of recycled fabrics can be recycled continuously, with less degradation of quality, thus to minizine the wastage as well.
                  <br />
                TAO itself has been GRS certified for years, and prioritize the use of GRS certified supplier and UNIFI products.
                <br />
                GRS (Global Recycling Standard) is an international, voluntary, full product standard that sets requirements for third-party certification of recycled content, chain of custody, social and environmental practices and chemical restrictions. 
                <br />
                The GRS is intended to meet the needs of companies looking to verify the recycled content of their products (both finished and intermediate) and to verify responsible social, environmental and chemical practices in their production. 
               <br />
                Unifi is the pioneer for recycled fabrics, come from recycled and reclaimed materials. These plastic bottles and/or pre-consumer fiber and fabric wastes have been given a new life, crushed into flakes and then transformed into pellets, melted and spun into yarn. Meanwhile, the water and energy consumption during the majority of processes such as bottle processing and dyeing operation is minimized with recovery system.

                Organic Fabrics
            </p>
            <p class="environmental-p3">
               Traditional cotton industry is labeled with strong agricultural poison to the environment due to the heavy dosage of herbicides and insecticide to control insects, pests, weeds and growth regulators, as well as the huge consumption of water during cultivation. 
               <br />
               Organic fibers are natural fibers grown strictly following national organic standards with minimum or no use of toxic pesticides. Organic fabrics are eco-friendly, and are made by treatment, the dyeing and finishing procedure are also strictly monitored with no use of chemicals and harmful dyes. Clothing made up of organic fabric is comfortable to wear, it absorbs moisture and skin-friendly. What’s more, there are no chemical retention on clothing, thus are very best choice for kids and/or people allergic to chemicals. 
               <br />
               The Global Organic Textile Standard (GOTS) certified fabrics represent the ultimate in ecological and sustainable production. It assures you that the flax from which this fabric was made was grown organically, without using insecticides or pesticides, and most ecological and socially responsible methods have been used throughout the entire production process. This means many other things:
           	<br />
                No GMO
           	<br />
                No harmful chemicals
                <br />
                No dyes or inks that have been classified as allergenic
               <br />
                No child labors
                <br />
                Öeko-Tex® Standard 100: is a global testing and accreditation program. It sets standards for the screening of chemicals and harmful substances in fabrics and other consumer textiles. Öeko-Tex® certified product is tested and approved to be no harmful chemicals, including formaldehyde, heavy metals, pesticides, phthalates, chlorinated phenols, colorants, solvents, and so on.
                <br />
                Tao itself has been registered with BCI, and requires suppliers to use BCI seed as many as possible, as well as other approved organic qualities.
                <br />
                Organic cotton is farmed on the surface of the Earth and have not been treated with no synthetic pesticides and chemical fertilizers for at least three years, while insects are combated in an environmentally friendly manner. Weeds are not sprayed but removed mechanically or manually. Picking the cotton balls is done manually, without defoliating the plant first. GMO is forbidden. Techniques such as composting and rotating make soils more absorbent, increasing the effectiveness of water usage, so less is needed.
                <br />
                Such natural clothing is desirable for all the year round wearing, and are very easy to be taken care of. They can be simply machine-washed with cold water and with different colors and fabrics. 
                <br />
                BCI (The Better Cotton Initiative) is a non-profit, multi-stakeholder governance group that promotes better standards in cotton farming and practices. It is a concept to grow cotton with proper use of water, chemical fertilizers and pesticides, to reduce the environmental harm of cotton farming. 
                 <br />
                Linen yarns and fabrics are considered to be one of the most sustainable textiles known. The flax plant, from which linen is made, doesn’t require irrigation during growth and even when it is grown conventionally it needs little or no treatment with herbicides or pesticides. Also, the process of turning the flax into linen is also simple and chemical-free. Linen is a natural product and 100% biodegradable and recyclable and feels very nice on the skin.
                 <br />
                Silk is a protein fiber, a luxurious natural product and has good properties that increase the wearing comfort. Silk fibers are welcomed for its breathable, absorbent and well insulating. GOTS-certified silk does not only relate to the raw material used, but mainly to the way it is processed into textiles. These mulberry trees, the leaves of which are eaten by the silkworms, are grown organically. The entire production process of the fabric has been carried out conform the ecological and social standards, butterflies are killed before they come out of the cocoon and before the filaments are unwound, in the so called peace silk the butterflies stay alive.
                 <br />
                TENCEL® of Lenzing has gained favorable acceptance within the mainstream fashion industry and also in the eco-fashion industry as being a natural fiber that has a flattering drape and is soft, luxurious, breathable, naturally wrinkle-resistant, and environmentally sustainable
                 <br />
                Just like rayon, it is made of wood, in this case eucalyptus wood. According to Lenzing, the wood comes from FSC managed forests, and solvents used in the pulping process are almost completely recovered and then reused. Tencel is also completely biodegradable. Another advantage is that it is a material that easily absorbs dyes, which means that much less dyes have to be used in dyeing than is the case with cotton, for

            <p class="environmental-p3">
                The use of chemicals and synthetic dyes produces hazardous and toxic waste during the coloring process, and has motivated the industry to explore new eco-friendly substitutes for minimizing their negative environmental impacts. Natural dyeing is an ancient tradition, and there are thousands of natural materials that make glorious colors in fabric, for example, plants, fruits and things from food waste.  
                  <br />
                The colors produced from natural dyes are vibrant, differs from each piece of garment. It is much more interesting than those made of synthetic. The more important is natural dyed products are not only nontoxic but also nonallergic, they are much better for the environment and for use around humans, especially for kids wear.

               Less waste, More sustainable 
            </p>
            <p class="environmental-p3">
                <br />Apart from the efforts on the supply chain control and eco-friendly materials improvements, there are still lots we can do to reduce and/or recycle the waste, here to mention what else we are contributing:
                <br />Tao aims to create attractive items with longer lifespan, ultimately reducing waste. We work closely with designers and buyers to adopt a whole lifecycle to product design, to identify textiles can be recycled or re-used
                <br />Tao encourages our partners to use 3D design and pattern, which allow creators to build virtual samples, less waste on sample making and parcel sending
                <br />Tao is working hard on improving accurate specifications of the patterns and cutting with maximum use of materials, and on reducing the errors that would lead to waste during production
                <br />Tao work with suppliers to invest on biotech, to make sure packaging materials, such as polybags, are degradable
                <br />Tao always take advantage of dead stock and leftover materials, to use fabrics that are already produced and sit on a shelf in a warehouse.
